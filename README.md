# Multimedia panel for a car (prototype)
## Here is the sketch for car panel. 

Thanks for this guys very much:
- [Rob Terpilowski](https://github.com/rterp) with his [Google maps api for JavaFX](https://github.com/rterp/GMapsFX) and
- [Bartosz Firyn](https://github.com/sarxos) with his [webcam library](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture).


There will be the next attempt to create by using [Qt platform](https://www.qt.io/) but this project is suitable to rapid prototyping the main idea.

Here is the screen capture for the main ideas:
